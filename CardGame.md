# Short description #
This is a traditional style tower defense game in which the towers are created by playing cards.  The player has some number of cards in his hand and a finite number of cards in his deck.  The deck is shuffled before each game, but the player gets to choose which cards are in the deck.
There are Three different kinds of cards.  Weapon Type cards are used in combination with Material Type cards to form towers.  Instant Action cards have various affects, such as sending out soldiers to fight for you or eliminating some number of enemies.
The cards are played in real time either during a wave or between them.  The player gets more cards in their hand as they kill enemies.  The number of cards in the player's hand might have a cap.
The player has the option to discard three random cards to destroy some number of random enemies.  This option is only available if you have enough cards.  This forces you to consider the number of cards in your deck and hand.
