# Short description #

A Tower Defense game, where the player fires the towers.

When a tower is built, a unique button in the keyboard is assigned to it as well as a direction, should the tower's attack require it. Then by pressing the assigned key, tower naturally fires it's attack.

To avoid success via smashing the keyboard (with hands or, as the name suggests, head),
atleast one of the following should be applied:
  * Towers have a reloading delay after firing. This makes the game more strategic.
  * Player gets negative points for not hitting the creeps. If this is applied, the waves should arrive only one at a time. Alternatively firing the towers should have a cost.


# Design notes #
# a reflex game

  * "frets on fire"
  * one button for each of the towers
  * a few can only fire at the same time
  * one tower has a timer?
  * or you get minus points for not hitting
  * limited resources
