# Puzzling puzzles #

Mainly the idea behind a puzzle based game is tile unscrambling. At the beginning of the game the user is presented with a grid of tiles which he/she must move around to combine them to into a picture of a tower (or some similar object) after which the player is rewarded with a tower.

Towers can also be moved in the same way. By transferring all the tiles of one single tower to a new location will also move the tower to this new location. Of course if all tiles were not moved the tower will disappear. The game could also be made more challenging if only the towers that where moved (e.g. during a break between the waves) could fire at the enemies.

Since the tile set is predefined at the beginning of the game the user can only have a limited amount of towers. The amount of possible towers could be the same as the amount of attacking enemies.
