Card data skeleton:

	name = "Stone",	
	--Name of the card

	type = "Material",
	--The cards type, can be "Material", "Weapon" or "Special"
	
	img = 'LuaUI/images/stone.png',
	--Picture of the card element, e.g. stone card = picture of a stone. I think were going with fake look for the pics. 
	--The card frame (background and other graphics) will be done with Spring UI.

	health = 1200,
	--The amount of health the card gives the new tower. The towers total health is mostly based on the used Material card,
	--though the used Weapon card can affect the total health in a small negative or positive way. Special type cards health 
	--is 0.
	--e.g. Material health 1000 + Weapon health -100 = Towers total health 900.

	reloadTime = 0.5,
	--The time it takes for the tower to reload after a shot, min value is 0. The towers total reload time will be the sum
	--of the used Material and Weapon cards reloadTime. Special type cards reload time is 0.
	--e.g. Material 0.8 + Weapon 0.5 = Towers total reload time 1.3

	range =  50,
	--How far will the towers projectile fly. The towers total range is mostly based on the used Weapon card, though the 
	--used Material card can affect the total range in a small negative or positive way. Special type cards reload time is 0.
	--e.g. Weapon range 300 + Material 40 = Towers total range 340

	damage =  0,
	--How much damage a projectile will do on contact. Based completly on the Weapon card. Material and Special type cards
	--damage is 0.
	--e.g. Weapon damage 100 = Towers total damage 100

	greenballs =  0,
	--How many greenballs it takes to use a card. The property gets negative values, max value is 0. The towers total 
	--greenball cost will be the sum of the used Material and Weapon cards greenball cost
	--e.g. Weapon greenball -2 + Material greenball 0 = Towers total greenball cost -2

	effect =  nil,
	--The effect value in a Special card is a table.  For Material and Weapon cards this entry is nil.
	--The effect table contains a function that performs the card's action.
	--The table also includes the effect's name and desc.
	--e.g.
	--	effect = {
	--		needsPos = false --If the effect function needs a selected pos
	--		needsUnit = false --If the effect function needs a selected unit
	--		effect = function(pos, unit) --This is run in synced code
	--			spEcho("HELLO!")
	--		end,
	--		name = "Greeting",
	--		desc = "Says Hello",
	--		cursor = function(x, y) end --This isn't used yet.  This will be run in unsynced code when the effect is selected (x and y are the mouse coords)
	--		draw = function(pos, unit) end --This isn't used yet.  This will be run in unsynced code when the effect is activated
	--	}

	desc = "Creates tall stone towers with decent range and good amount of health,\n" ..
		"but due to tall design, adds additional weapon reloading time.",
	--Short description about the card	


The cards are located in src/luarules/gadgets/darius_card_pool.lua, though there will probably be a cards directory with a lua
file for each card.
If you want to see your card in game modify the function SendDecks() by adding the call Darius:AddCard(table.copy(cards[5]), 1)
where cards[5] is the fifth card in the the array and 1 is the deck number, can also be 2.
