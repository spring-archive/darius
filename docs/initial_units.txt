Units go from weakest to strongest, e.g. chicken = weakest and armwar = strongest
Number is the dynamic unit id number (if you wanna try spawning with darius_tower_logic, won't be needed in the future)

normal:	chicken = 15, //weak, slow and only close range attack
	corthud = 55, //simple mech, decent health and shot range
	arm_venom = 1, //spider mech, shoots emp lightning that halts tower fire
	corstorm = 54, //mech, similar to corthud but overall better, shoots missiles
	armsptk = 13, //spider mech, shoots a burst of missiles 
	chicken_sporeshooter = 28, //shoots a burst of spores, good health and damage
	armwar = 14 //best normal unit, good health and damage but not the best range

fast and weak: 
	armpw = 12, //mech infantry unit
	corpyro = 49, //fire mech
	chicken_dodo = 19, //suicide bomber
	chicken_leaper = 22, //can jump over obstacles and enemy fire, strong but needs to get in close range 
	corpyro_new = 50 //shoots wide and really damaging fire

slow and strong:
	chickena = 29, //strong, but needs to get in close range
	cormortgold = 48, //shoots fast and damaging cannon shots
	chickenc = 32, //shoots burst of damaging green goo
	armorco = 10, //the most powerful mech in the game 
	chickenq = 36 //huge, possible boss, since now crazy powerful
