Mklink isn't available on Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Directory symbolic
links are known as "NTFS junctions" in Windows 2000 and Windows XP.
Despite the fact that Vista and Windows 7 have a build-in mklink-program
for creating REAL symbolic links, these junctions work also in Windows Vista
and Windows 7)

So if you have Windows 2000 or Windows XP, use this program:

I already added the junction.exe to this folder so you don't have to download
anything.

junction.exe -s "[Your Spring Install Directory]\mods\darius.sdd" "[Your SVN Trunk]\src"
junction.exe -s "[Your Spring Install Directory]\maps" "[Your SVN Trunk]\maps"

-s stands for recurse subdirectories

To delete junctions, use the â€“d switch:
junction.exe -d "[Your Spring Install Directory]\mods\darius.sdd"
junction.exe -d "[Your Spring Install Directory]\maps"

As expected, removing junctions does not remove the original folders.
