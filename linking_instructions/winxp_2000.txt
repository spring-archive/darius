Mklink isn't available on Windows 2000 and Windows XP as these don't have
REAL symbolic links. Directory symbolic links are known as "NTFS junction
points" in Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Despite the fact that Vista and
Windows 7 have a handy build-in mklink-program for creating real symbolic links,
junctions work also in Windows Vista and Windows 7). Note: Junction points can
only link to directories on the same local volume.

If you have Windows 2000 or Windows XP, you must this program:

I added the junction.exe to this folder so you don't have to even download it.

junction.exe -s "[Your Spring Install Directory]\mods\darius.sdd" "[Your SVN Trunk]\src"
junction.exe -s "[Your Spring Install Directory]\maps" "[Your SVN Trunk]\maps"

(-s stands for recurse subdirectories)

To delete junctions, use the â€“d switch:
junction.exe -d "[Your Spring Install Directory]\mods\darius.sdd"
junction.exe -d "[Your Spring Install Directory]\maps"

As expected, removing junctions does not remove the original folders.
