/*How to Use:
1. Copy the following to  the top of your unit script, below the piecenum declarations. MAKE SURE YOU REPLACE VALUES WHEN APPROPRIATE.


#define SIG_TILT_Z				2		//Signal to prevent multiple tilting. REPLACE!

//tiltz
#define TILT_PIECE				0		//piece to tilt. REPLACE!
#define TILT_Z_ANGLE			<-5>	//How much to tilt at maximum
#define TILT_Z_DIST				[5]		//Typically half the width of the unit. Keeps the unit's edges from sinking into the ground.
#define TILT_Z_SPEED			8		//Number of half-cycles per second around z-axis

#include "tiltz.h"

2. For each weapon that you want to cause tilting, do the following:
	2a. Create a static variable gun_X_yaw.
	2b. In AimWeaponX, put the following line before the return(1); line:
		gun_X_yaw = heading;
	2c. In FireWeaponX or ShotX, put the following line:
		start-script TiltZ(heading);
